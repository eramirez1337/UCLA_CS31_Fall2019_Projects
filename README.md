# UCLA_CS31_Fall2019_Projects
Projects for Smallberg's CS31 class
These are my projects that I have done in CS31 at UCLA Fall 2019 quarter. 
Heed this warning: you can use this code as reference,but I would highly
suggest not copying the code word for word. You can't get CS experience
without actually thinking about and building your code!

Anyway, here is my work. Enjoy!
