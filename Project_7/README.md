All of your hard work leads to this. Essentially, you are making a game (fun, isn't it?)! Smallberg, our holy Lord and Saviour, will first assign a simple warm-up that will introduce you to how classes and pointers to classes work. Then, he will give you a project that will MOST LIKELY be similar to this one. The most difficult function here is recommendMove, which requires you to move the player to a spot where you will most likely not die from the vampires, which is easier said than done. Once you are done with Project 7, all that's left is a final. Huzzah!
